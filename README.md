# NeuroBrush

Built an end-to-end Neural Style Transfer pipeline using PyTorch, Torchvision, and VGG-19, applying deep
learning to image synthesis tasks. Designed custom loss functions and used Adam optimizer with learning rate
scheduling. Enhanced visual fidelity through color histogram matching (skimage), image preprocessing with PIL,
and GPU-accelerated tensor operations
